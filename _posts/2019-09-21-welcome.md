**It's great to have you here** :)

To briefly introduce, we are an academic program in East Coweta High School serving to **encourage STEM education for talented and passionate learners**.


### Few things first:
1. We operate through an application process starting in fall of 8th grade year. 
    If you are a 9th grader seeking to join, that is fine too.
2. We want students with: (some ideal values, especially passion)
3. 


Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our [Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing) service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern journalism.

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: [the Ghost editor](https://demo.ghost.io/the-editor/).

Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
